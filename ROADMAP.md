# Somewhat Roadmap

I kinda want to use this as a guideline when to do what and not just do everything all the time.
I have most of the things in my head but it's always nice to write things down to keep track of them.
Thus, there might be instances where I ignore this and do something else instead of what I planned, but I'll try to keep this up to date.

Also note that these are just the "bigger things" that I want to get done but more smaller things will probably pile up for those releases.
